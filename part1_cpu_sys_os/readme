Using "make" to compile all the codes

For part 1 : CPU, SYSTEM, and OS:
run "./cpu_sys_os.x #1 #2":
     in which:
     #1 = 1 : reading measurement
     (#1 #2) = (2 N) : procedure call measurement wiht N parameters, e.g. "./cpu_sys_os.x 2 5"
     #1 = 3 : system call measurement
     #1 = 4 : process creation measurement
     #1 = 5 : kernel thread creation measurement
     #1 = 6 : process context switch measurement
     #1 = 7 : kernel thread context switch measurement
     #1 = 8 : looping overhead measurement
