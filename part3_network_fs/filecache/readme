type "make" for compile
check you main memory size
type "./mfile #" to create a file with # GB size where # is you main memory size
then you will get testfile#G.txt
please rename it to be "testfile#G_1.txt", and copy it as "testfile#G_2.txt"
so you will have two files "testfile#G_1.txt" and "testfile#G_2.txt"
go into test.b, and change "testfile8G_1.txt" to "testfile#G_1.txt"
              , and change "testfile8G_2.txt" to "testfile#G_2.txt"
              where # is you main memory size
              , change "for i in {0..4}" to "for i in {0..@}" where @ is # - 1
              for example, if you main memory size is 8, then change it to "for i in {0..7}"
type "./test.b" for running the code

then you will get
