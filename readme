To run, type:
     chmod 777 run.x
     ./run.x #1 #2
     
#1 is an int between 1 ~ 7, representing:
1: reading measurement
2: procedure call measurement
3: system call measurement
4: process creation measurement
5: kernal thread creation measurement
6: process context switch measurement
7: kernal thread context switch measurement


#2 is an int between 0 ~ 7, representing the number of parameters to pass when #1==2

Outputs are saved in .rst file accordingly, with each number representing the number of cycles for each operation.


E.g.,
./run.x 1   // measure the reading
./run.x 2 5 // measure procedure call with 5 parameter passing
